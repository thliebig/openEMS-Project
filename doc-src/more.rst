Documentation and Q&A
-----------------------------

Currently, openEMS's documentation is still in the process of migrating from
the legacy Wiki to the new GitHub repository. Thus, many documents are
currently missing here. For now, please visit:

FDTD
---------

If you're new to FDTD, the following university-level textbooks provide a good
general introduction to the FDTD method:

* John B. Schneider (2010). Understanding the FDTD Method. available online. http://eecs.wsu.edu/~schneidj/ufdtd/index.php

* Allen Taflove; Susan C. Hagness (2005). Computational Electrodynamics: The Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method, 3rd ed. Artech House Publishers. ISBN 978-1-58053-832-9.
